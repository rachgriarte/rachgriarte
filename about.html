			<h2>Hello, my name is Rachel</h2>
				<p class="black-text">
					I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with frameworks; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
					I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.
				</p>

			<h2>User Interface & User Experience</h2>
			<p class="black-text">I began my passion for coding, specifically the UI/UX, when I was introduced to a Web Design seminar. Since then, I've taken an interest in designing the look and the feel of a website. 
					I enjoy digging deep into the psychology behind a user's mind which helps me visualize the user's experience in all of my work.</p>

			<div class="carousel-item black-text" id="three">
			<h2>Social Media Officer</h2>
			<p class="black-text">Being a Social Media Officer at my former company has been a huge barrier for my interest in the technology world. It is to understand how social media plays into marketing. It's a tool. Social media is a communication tool in marketing. It makes you accessible to people: those interested in your product and those that don't know your product.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="carousel-item black-text" id="four">
			<h2>Never Stop Learning</h2>
			<p class="black-text">I believe that a developer does not have to be an expert in everything, but a developer should demonstrate a natural curiosity by the breadth of their experience. From mobile to web to print, these pieces show just enough of my range of expertise that a client could feel confident about breaking new ground.</p>
