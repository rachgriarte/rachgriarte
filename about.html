						<div class="collapsible-body"><span style="font-size: 13px">I began my passion for coding, specifically the UI/UX, when I was introduced to a Web Design seminar. Since then, I've taken an interest in designing the look and the feel of a website. 
								I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with frameworks; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
								Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy digging deep into the psychology behind a user's mind which helps me visualize the user's experience in all of my work.

						<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_2</i>Social Media Officer</div>
						<div class="collapsible-body"><span>Being a Social Media Officer at my former company has been a huge barrier for my interest in the technology world. It is to understand how social media plays into marketing. It's a tool. Social media is a communication tool in marketing. It makes you accessible to people: those interested in your product and those that don't know your product.

						<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_3</i>Wise Words</div>
						<div class="collapsible-body"><span>I believe that a developer does not have to be an expert in everything, but a developer should demonstrate a natural curiosity by the breadth of their experience. From mobile to web to print, these pieces show just enough of my range of expertise that a client could feel confident about breaking new ground.

					My name is Rachel but I typically go by Rach. I am a UX Designer enthusiast! After completing the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp Program at UNC, I've finally found what keeps me coding 15+ hours a day and that is my passion for engaging in a user's experience in my application.  I know it comes from my knowledge of fashion and psychology. I am currently in a pause of rebranding my family's fashion company called Griarte. I was Customer Service Lead, Social Media Officer, and Fashion Stylist. I truly enjoyed all of my experience, however, my love for coding has begun and I am looking forward to creating a profession for myself in the Technology field!
